# Introduction

Endpoint events is a method for Kaa services to communicate events that occur to endpoints.
The events are defined as [broadcast messages](/0003/README.md#broadcast-messaging) with `endpoint` target entity type.
This document describes the NATS subject and Avro message format for each event message.


# Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).


# NATS subject format

Originators MUST publish endpoint events to the following NATS subjects:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.{event-group}.{event-type}
```

where:
- `{originator-service-instance-name}` is the name of the originator service instance. Allows listeners to subscribe to events from a specific originator.
- `{event-group}` is a logical group of events. For example, connectivity, lifecycle, etc.
- `{event-type}` is a specific event type. For example, endpoint connectivity event types could be `connected`, `disconnected`, `dormant`, `awake`, etc.


# Connectivity events

Connectivity events are used for notifying listeners about the communication session status transitions between an endpoint and server.
The `{event-group}` is `connectivity`.


## Endpoint connected

Endpoint connected event is published when endpoint opens a communication session with server.
The `{event-type}` is `connected`.

Originators MUST use the following NATS subject format for endpoint connected events:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.connectivity.connected
```

The NATS message payload is an Avro object with the following schema ([ep-connected.avsc](./ep-connected.avsc)):

```json
{
   "namespace":"org.kaaproject.ipc.event.gen.v1.endpoint.connectivity",
   "name":"ConnectedEvent",
   "type":"record",
   "doc":"Endpoints connected event message",
   "fields":[

         "name":"correlationId",
         "type":"string",
         "doc":"Message ID primarily used to track message processing across services"
      },
      {

         "doc":"Message creation UNIX timestamp in milliseconds"
      },
      {
         "name":"timeout",
         "type":"long",
         "default":0,
         "doc":"Amount of milliseconds since the timestamp until the message expires. Value of 0 is reserved to indicate no expiration."
      },
      {

               "name":"EndpointMeta",
               "doc":"Endpoint metadata.",
               "fields":[
                  {
                     "name":"appVersion",
                     "type":"string",
                     "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint application"
                  },
                  {
                     "name":"tenantId",
                     "type":"string",
                     "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint tenant"
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      },
      {
         "name":"originatorReplicaId",
         "type":"string",
         "doc":"Identifier of the service replica that generated the event"
      }
   ]
}
```


## Endpoint disconnected

Endpoint disconnected event is published when endpoint communication session with server becomes unavailable because of a disconnect, timeout, or other reasons.
The `{event-type}` is `disconnected`.

Originators MUST use the following NATS subject format for endpoint disconnected events:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.connectivity.disconnected
```

The NATS message payload is an Avro object with the following schema ([ep-disconnected.avsc](./ep-disconnected.avsc)):

```json
{
   "namespace":"org.kaaproject.ipc.event.gen.v1.endpoint.connectivity",
   "name":"DisconnectedEvent",
   "type":"record",
   "doc":"Endpoints disconnected event message",
   "fields":[
      {
         "name":"correlationId",
         "type":"string",
         "doc":"Message ID primarily used to track message processing across services"
      },
      {
         "name":"timestamp",
         "type":"long",
         "doc":"Message creation UNIX timestamp in milliseconds"
      },
      {
         "name":"timeout",
         "type":"long",
         "default":0,
         "doc":"Amount of milliseconds since the timestamp until the message expires. Value of 0 is reserved to indicate no expiration."
      },
      {
         "name":"endpoints",
         "doc":"Disconnected endpoints' IDs map to their application version names",
         "type":{
            "type":"map",
            "values":{
               "type":"record",
               "name":"EndpointMeta",
               "doc":"Endpoint metadata.",
               "fields":[
                  {
                     "name":"appVersion",
                     "type":"string",
                     "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint application"
                  },
                  {
                     "name":"tenantId",
                     "type":"string",
                     "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint tenant"
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      },
      {
         "name":"originatorReplicaId",
         "type":"string",
         "doc":"Identifier of the service replica that generated the event"
      }
   ]
}
```

When originating service handles a disconnect of a client communication session, associated with multiple endpoints (see [Client vs endpoint](/0001/README.md#client-vs-endpoint)), it SHOULD publish an endpoint disconnected event with all endpoint IDs instead of publishing a separate event for every endpoint.


# Lifecycle events

Lifecycle events are for notifying listeners about the endpoint events such as the initial registration, appversion update, and removal.
The `{event-group}` is `lifecycle`.


## Endpoint registered

The `{event-type}` is `registered`.
Published when an endpoint first registers in the system.

Originators MUST use the following NATS subject format for endpoint registered events:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.lifecycle.registered
```

The NATS message payload is an Avro object with the following schema ([0009-ep-registered.avsc](./0009-ep-registered.avsc)):

```json
{
    "namespace":"org.kaaproject.ipc.event.gen.v1.endpoint.lifecycle",
    "name":"RegisteredEvent",
    "type":"record",
    "doc":"Endpoint registered event message",
    "fields":[
        {
            "name":"correlationId",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Message ID primarily used to track message processing across services"
        },
        {
            "name":"timestamp",
            "type":"long",
            "doc":"Message creation UNIX timestamp in milliseconds"
        },
        {
            "name":"timeout",
            "type":"long",
            "default":0,
            "doc":"Amount of milliseconds since the timestamp until the message expires. Value of 0 is reserved to indicate no expiration."
        },
        {
            "name":"appVersionName",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Application version name the endpoint registered with"
        },
        {
            "name":"endpointId",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint that registered with the server"
        },
        {
            "name":"originatorReplicaId",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Identifier of the service replica that generated the event"
        }
    ]
}
```

    "name":"AppVersionUpdatedEvent",
    "type":"record",
    "doc":"Endpoint's application version updated event message",
    "fields":[
        {
            "name":"correlationId",

        },
        {
            "name":"timeout",
            "type":"long",
            "default":0,
            "doc":"Amount of milliseconds since the timestamp until the message expires. Value of 0 is reserved to indicate no expiration."
        },
        {
            "name":"appVersionName",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Application version name the endpoint updated to"
        },
        {

            "type":"string",
            "doc":"The previous application version name the endpoint was registered in"
        },
        {
            "name":"endpointId",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint that registered with the server"
        },

            "doc":"Identifier of the service replica that generated the event"
        }
    ]

# Traffic reporting

Traffic reporting events are for notifying listeners about endpoint events, such as the amount of payload received or sent.
The `{event-group}` is `traffic-reporting`.

## Endpoint payload reports

The `{event-type}` is `payload`.
The sender publishes these events periodically to report the aggregate amount of payload received from or sent to endpoints in the reporting time frame.

Originator MUST use the following NATS subject format for the traffic payload size events:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.traffic-reporting.payload
```

The NATS message payload is an Avro object with the following schema ([0009-ep-traffic-stats.avsc](0009-ep-traffic-stats.avsc)):
