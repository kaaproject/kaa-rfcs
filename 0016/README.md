# Introduction

Endpoint and Client Authentication Protocol (ECAP) is designed for authentication services to provide [endpoints and clients](/0001/README.md#language) authentication and identification interface to other services in the Kaa platform.

ECAP complies with the [Inter-Service Messaging](/0003/README.md) guidelines.


# Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

The following terms and definitions are used in this RFC.

- **Authentication provider service (provider)**: service that exposes ECAP to other services for endpoint and client authentication.

- **Authentication consumer service (consumer)**: service that uses ECAP interface exposed by a provider to authenticate endpoints and clients.


# Design

## Endpoint identification

### Endpoint identification by token

#### Endpoint token validation request

*Endpoint token validation request* message is a [targeted message](/0003/README.md#targeted-messaging) that consumer sends to provider to make sure that the endpoint is allowed to connect and to resolve the endpoint ID.

The consumer MUST send endpoint token validation request messages using the following NATS subject:
```
kaa.v1.service.{provider-service-instance-name}.ecap.ep-token-request
```

The consumer MUST include NATS `replyTo` field to handle the response.
It is RECOMMENDED to follow the subject format described in [3/ISM session affinity section](/0003/README.md#session-affinity):
```
kaa.v1.replica.{consumer-service-replica-id}.ecap.ep-token-response
```

Endpoint token validation request message payload MUST be an [Avro-encoded](https://avro.apache.org/) object with the following schema ([0016-endpoint-token-validation-request.avsc](./0016-endpoint-token-validation-request.avsc)):

```json
{
    "namespace":"org.kaaproject.ipc.ecap.gen.v1",
    "name":"EndpointTokenValidationRequest",
    "type":"record",
    "doc":"EP token validation request message",
    "fields":[
        {
            "name":"correlationId",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Message ID primarily used to track message processing across services"
        },
        {
            "name":"timestamp",
            "type":"long",
            "doc":"Message creation UNIX timestamp in milliseconds"
        },
        {
            "name":"timeout",
            "type":"long",
            "default":0,
            "doc":"Amount of milliseconds (since the timestamp) until the message expires. Value of 0 is reserved to indicate no expiration."
        },
        {
            "name":"appName",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Application name of the endpoint, for which the token validation is requested"
        },
        {
            "name":"token",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Endpoint token to validate"
        }
    ]
}
```


#### Endpoint token validation response

*Endpoint token validation response* message MUST be sent by provider in response to an [endpoint token validation request message](#endpoint-token-validation-request).
Provider MUST publish endpoint token validation response message to the subject provided in the NATS `replyTo` field of the request.

Endpoint token validation response message payload MUST be an Avro-encoded object with the following schema ([0016-endpoint-token-validation-response.avsc](./0016-endpoint-token-validation-response.avsc)):
```json
{
    "namespace":"org.kaaproject.ipc.ecap.gen.v1",
    "name":"EndpointTokenValidationResponse",
    "type":"record",
    "doc":"EP token validation response message",
    "fields":[
        {
            "name":"correlationId",
            "type":"string",
            "doc":"Message ID primarily used to track message processing across services"
        },

            "doc":"Message creation UNIX timestamp in milliseconds"
        },
        {
            "name":"timeout",

            "doc":"ID of the resolved token. May be null in case token is not found."
        },
        {
            "name":"endpointId",
            "type":[
                "string",
                "null"
            ],
            "doc":"Identifier of the endpoint resolved by the provided token. May be null in case token is not found."

        },
        {
            "name":"reasonPhrase",
            "type":[
              "null",
              "string"
            ],
            "default":null,
            "doc":"Human-readable status reason phrase"
        }
    ]
}
```


#### Endpoint token revocation event

Provider MUST publish *endpoint token revoked event* whenever one or more previously valid endpoint tokens become unusable for endpoint identification.
On receipt of this event consumers MUST take immediate measures for terminating active endpoint communication sessions where listed tokens are used for endpoint identification.

Endpoint token revoked event is a [broadcast message](/0003/README.md#broadcast-messaging) with `endpoint` target entity type, `token` event group, and `revoked` event type.

Providers MUST use the following NATS subject format for endpoint token revoked events:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.token.revoked
```

Endpoint token revoked event message payload MUST be an Avro-encoded object with the following schema ([0016-endpoint-token-revoked.avsc](./0016-endpoint-token-revoked.avsc)):

```json
{
    "namespace":"org.kaaproject.ipc.ecap.gen.v1",

            "doc":"Identifier of the service replica that generated the event"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Client authentication

### Client authentication by username and password

#### Client username and password validation request

*Client username and password validation request* message is a targeted message that consumer sends to provider to make sure that the client is allowed to connect and to resolve the client ID.

The consumer MUST send client username and password validation request messages using the following NATS subject:
```
kaa.v1.service.{provider-service-instance-name}.ecap.client-username-password-request
```

The consumer MUST include NATS `replyTo` field to handle the response.
It is RECOMMENDED to follow the subject format described in [3/ISM session affinity section](/0003/README.md#session-affinity):

Provider MUST publish client username and password validation response message to the subject provided in the NATS `replyTo` field of the request.

Client username and password validation response message payload MUST be an Avro-encoded object with the following schema ([0016-client-username-password-validation-response.avsc](./0016-client-username-password-validation-response.avsc)):

        }
    ]
}
```


### Client authentication by SSL certificate

#### Client certificate validation request

*Client certificate validation request* message is a targeted message that consumer sends to provider to make sure that the client is allowed to connect and to resolve the client ID.
Provider does not perform standard certificate verification (signature, authority, expiration, etc.).
Consumer MUST perform such verification prior to sending a client certificate validation request to provider.

The consumer MUST send client certificate validation request messages using the following NATS subject:
```
kaa.v1.service.{provider-service-instance-name}.ecap.client-certificate-request
```

The consumer MUST include NATS `replyTo` field to handle the response.
It is RECOMMENDED to follow the subject format described in [3/ISM session affinity section](/0003/README.md#session-affinity):
```
kaa.v1.replica.{consumer-service-replica-id}.ecap.client-certificate-response
```

Client certificate validation request message payload MUST be an Avro-encoded object with the following schema ([0016-client-certificate-validation-request.avsc](./0016-client-certificate-validation-request.avsc)):

Client credential revoked event is a [broadcast message](/0003/README.md#broadcast-messaging) with `client` target entity type, `credential` event group, and `revoked` event type.

Providers MUST use the following NATS subject format for client credential revoked events:
