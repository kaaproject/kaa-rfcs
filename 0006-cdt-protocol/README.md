## Introduction

Configuration Data Transport (CDT) protocol is designed to communicate endpoint configuration data between Kaa services.

In Kaa architecture, some services are designed to manage endpoint configuration in different ways â€” store it, process it, publish it, etc.
One of the core features in such context is the ability to send and receive endpoint configurations.

For this purpose, the CDT protocol is designed.
It defines the endpoint configuration data structure so that it's interpreted by all involved services in the same way.

In CDT lingo, sending an endpoint configuration to a service is called *configuration push*, while receiving it from a service is called *configuration pull*.

To effectively perform these activities, endpoint configuration data should be communicated in a format recognized by all the services involved.
To achieve this, CDT protocol was designed based on the [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] protocol.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

The following terms and definitions are used in this RFC.

- **Configuration push**: sending an endpoint configuration data to a service.
- **Configuration pull**: receiving an endpoint configuration data from a service.
- **EP configuration provider (provider)**: any service that sends an endpoint configuration to the other service.
- **EP configuration consumer (consumer)**: any service that receives an endpoint configuration from the other service.

## Requirements and constraints

CDT requirements:

- Once a new endpoint configuration is pushed, there must be an EP configuration provider broadcasting an event over [NATS](http://nats.io/) about the new configuration availability.
- The provider must receive a confirmation that the EP configuration was successfully pushed to the consumer.
- When a consumer tries to pull an endpoint configuration that does not exist, or in case of other errors during configuration pull, HTTP status codes and arbitrary reason phrases must be used to inform about the errors occurred.

## Design

### Configuration pull

Configuration pull is used when a service is intended to request particular configuration.

No delivery confirmation is required for configuration pull, as endpoint can detect delivery fail and request configuration again.

#### Subject structure

The [EP configuration consumer](#language) should send messages using this NATS subject:
```
kaa.v1.service.{cdp-service-instance-name}.cmx2cdp.{message-type}
```

Also, the consumer should include NATS `replyTo` field pointing to the consumer service replica that will handle the response:
```
kaa.v1.replica.{cmx-service-instance-replica-id}.cmx2cdp.{message-type}
```

For more information, see [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC].

#### Targeted message types

There are two types of targeted messages:
- `ConfigRequest` message is sent by EP configuration consumer.
- `ConfigResponse` message is sent by [EP configuration provider](#language) service.

`ConfigRequest` message structure:

- `correlationId` (string, required): refer to [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] RFC for description.<!--TODO-->
- `timestamp` (number, required): message creation timestamp.
- `timeout` (number, required): amount of time (starting from the timestamp) before the message gets ignored.
- `endpointMessageId` (string, required): unique identifier of original endpoint message.
- `appVersionName` (string, required): application version to which the endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required): unique identifier of endpoint to which the configuration is applicable.
- `configId` (string, optional): unique identifier of endpoint configuration.
If not present, response message will hold the latest version of configuration.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "07d78e95-2c4d-4899-957c-b9e5a3701fbb",
  "timestamp": 1490303342158,
  "timeout": 3000,
  "endpointMessageId": "6b73cd7c-1de5-4c4e-bbad-b7eda079ccbd",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1"
}
```

`ConfigResponse` message structure:

- `correlationId` (string, required): refer to [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] RFC for description.<!--TODO-->
- `timestamp` (number, required): message creation timestamp.
- `timeout` (number, required): amount of time (starting from the timestamp) before the message gets ignored.
- `endpointMessageId` (string, required): unique identifier of original endpoint message.
- `appVersionName` (string, required): application version to which the endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required): unique identifier of endpoint to which the configuration is applicable.
- `contentType` (string, required): type of configuration content, e.g.: JSON, Protocol Buffer.
- `configId` (string, required): unique identifier of endpoint configuration.
- `statusCode` (number, required): status code containing information about the result of inbound message processing.
- `reasonPhrase` (string, optional): status code containing information about the result of inbound message processing.
- `content` (byte[], optional): configuration data.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "07d78e95-2c4d-4899-957c-b9e5a3701fbb",
  "timestamp": 1490303342158,
  "timeout": 3000,
  "endpointMessageId": "6b73cd7c-1de5-4c4e-bbad-b7eda079ccbd",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "contentType": "json",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "reasonPhrase": "OK",
  "content": {
    "bytes": "d2FpdXJoM2pmbmxzZGtjdjg3eTg3b3cz"
  }
}
```

### Configuration push

Pushing a notification from provider to consumer can be designed as an event.
Alternatively, the event-based approach can be used as described in [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC] RFC.

When an endpoint updates its configuration to a certain version, an EP configuration provider should broadcast an event about this.

#### Subject structure

Both the EP configuration provider and consumer should listen to this subject and send messages to it:
```
kaa.v1.events.{originator-service-instance-name}.endpoint.config.{event-type}
```

For more information, see [3/Messaging IPC][3/MIPC].

There are two types of such messages:
- `ConfigUpdated` message is initiated by EP configuration provider when it receives notification that particular endpoint has updated configuration.
- `ConfigNewAvailable` message is initiated by EP configuration consumer when it receives new configuration.

`ConfigUpdated` message structure:

- `appVersionName` (string, required): application version to which endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required): unique identifier of endpoint to which configuration is applicable.
- `configId` (string, required): unique identifier of endpoint configuration.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "6fd9b270-2b74-428b-a86f-fee018b932f0",
  "eventTimestamp": 1490350896332,
  "originatorReplicaId": "1758dc39-63d2-47d0-9b58-6f617a4e0bba",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1"
}
```

`ConfigNewAvailable` message structure:

- `appVersionName` (string, required): application version to which the endpoint configuration is applicable.
- `endpointId` (string, required): endpoint unique identifier to which the configuration is applicable.
- `configId` (string, required): unique identifier of endpoint configuration.

Example:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "0fce883f-1104-4da7-8a35-e790ecced6ac",
  "eventTimestamp": 1490351044418,
  "originatorReplicaId": "3b823589-d90b-497e-91f8-0209ecaef908",
  "appVersionName": "39774993-a426-4092-9e38-02ec213272d0",
  "endpointId": "b197e391-1d13-403b-83f5-87bdd44888cf",
  "configId": "76d34f8b-c038-413f-b122-318dce49edd1",
  "contentType": "json",
  "content": {
    "bytes": "d2FpdXJoM2pmbmxzZGtjdjg3eTg3b3cz"
  }
}
```
