# Introduction

Time Series Transmission Protocol (TSTP) is designed to communicate endpoint time series data from transmitter to receiver services in the Kaa platform.

TSTP complies with the [Inter-Service Messaging](/0003/README.md) guidelines.


# Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

The following terms and definitions are used in this RFC.

- **Data point**: data structure consisting of a timestamp and one or more values.
Data point values can be of arbitrary primitive or composite data type.

- **Endpoint time series (time series)**: uniquely named series of endpoint-related data points.

- **Time series data transmitter service (transmitter)**: service that sends endpoint time series data.

- **Time series data receiver service (receiver)**: service that receives endpoint time series data for storage, processing, etc.


# Design

## Time series data transmission to receivers

In order to send endpoint data points to receivers, transmitters MUST [broadcast](/0003/README.md#broadcast-messaging) endpoint time series events to the following NATS subjects:
```
kaa.v1.events.<transmitter-service-instance-name>.endpoint.data-collection.data-points-received.<time-series-name>
```

where:
- `<transmitter-service-instance-name>` is the instance name of the transmitter service.
This allows listeners to subscribe to events from a specific transmitter.
- `<time-series-name>` is the name of the time series the transmitted data points belong to.

The NATS message payload is an Avro object with the following schema ([0014-ep-time-series-event.avsc](./0014-ep-time-series-event.avsc)):

## No receipt acknowledgement

Receivers MUST NOT acknowledge the receipt of time series events.


# Open questions

## Receipt acknowledgement

Is it worth acknowledging time series events?
In the current version of the protocol there is no delivery guarantee whatsoever.
This might pose a problem for receivers that rely on uninterrupted events delivery.
